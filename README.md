# Broadcast Receivers Example App

This repository contains the source code for an Android app demonstrating the use of broadcast receivers. The app listens for changes in the airplane mode setting and logs whether it is enabled or disabled.

## Features

* **Dynamic Broadcast Receiver:** The app dynamically registers and unregisters the broadcast receiver at runtime.

* **Airplane Mode Detection:** Logs whether airplane mode is turned on or off.

* **Minimal Codebase:** Focuses solely on the essentials to help you understand broadcast receivers in Android.

## Code Overview

### Key Components

1. **AirPlaneModeReceiver:** A class that extends BroadcastReceiver to handle the broadcast for airplane mode changes.

2. **MainActivity:** The main activity where the receiver is registered and unregistered dynamically.
